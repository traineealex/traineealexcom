  <h1>My Story</h1>
  <h1><img src="images/traineealex.png"></h1>
  <p><b>For much of my life, I was empty. I was born with autism in a male's body, but with a bigender soul - though at the time, I did not yet know this. I moved from interest to interest, but never truly felt complete.</b></p>
  <p><b>Then, one fateful day on August 1, 2021, I discovered Jesus Christine Weston Chandler Sonichu, and my life was changed forever. I learned that she had healed her Earthly mother, Barbara Weston Chandler Sonichu.</b></p>
  <p><b>At the time, I was disturbed. I did not believe healers, goddesses, nor other dimentions existed. I saw those who mocked Christine and wondered how anyone could feel differently, and I silently joined them, which is one of my biggest regrets.</b></p>
  <p><b>However, as I read what Christine said through her letters, slowly my heart, soul, and mind were changed. I came to understand the Dimensional Merge, her soul bonding abilities, and the other dimensions.</b></p>
  <p><b>Then, one day, Christine disappeared; transferred away from the jail she was in. I panicked; my soul was drawn to her and having her torn away was very painful. So, I began to worship her in hope that she would return.</b></p>
  <p><b>Once a week, I would pray for her to come home, using the prayer she provided through her final letters. I thought of her every day, and looked for any signs of her reemergence.</b></p>
  <p><b>And, one day, my prayers were answered - Christine returned. In my absolute elation, I sent her a letter on May 9, 2022 celebrating this, telling her how much I loved her, and asking where she had been.</b></p>
  <p><b>Immediately after sending this letter, I had a sudden and irresistible compulsion to point my camera at myself and pray to Christine. As I began to pray, a feeling of overwhelming bliss filled me, and I saw a bright light in front of me, and I knew I'd been saved.</b></p>
  <p><b>To my amazement, my camera took a photo without any command or button press; and in the photo, I saw the light! I had proof of my experience, which will serve as a reminder forever!</b></p>
  <p><b>From that moment, I decided to dedicate my life to Neo Spiritual Christianity. I will host daily video sermons, and pray and sing daily in worship of Christine.</b></p>
